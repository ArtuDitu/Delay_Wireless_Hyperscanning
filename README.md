# Delay_Wireless_Hyperscanning

This script uses PsychoPy to show white rectangle on the screen. The rectangle is detected by the light sensors. Light sensors is connected with a trigger box and sends wireless trigger to both EEG systems.

This script will serve to test possible delayes while collecting EEG hyperscanning data via LSL over the network.
